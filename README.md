# Renaissance Dance Bibliography

A long time ago the RENDANCE mailing list built a large annotated
bibliography of books and articles relevant to Renaissance Dance.
This repository is the descendant of that effort.

TODO:

* CI to validate the XML
* A "one page" website to at least load up the whole thing
* A pretty website to display and search entries
* A pretty website to all adding and editing entries

Credits:

* Many individuals contribitued individual entries
* Andrew Draskoy did the initial work to put this data into xml
* Aaron Elkiss helped re-create the .xsd and validate things
