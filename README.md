# Renaissance Dance Bibliography

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rendance/rendancebib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rendance/rendancebib)

A long time ago the RENDANCE mailing list built a large annotated
bibliography of books and articles relevant to Renaissance Dance.
This repository is the descendant of that effort.

TODO:

* A "one page" website to at least load up the whole thing
* A pretty website to search and display entries
* A pretty website to allow adding and editing entries

Possible software:

* https://github.com/UNC-Libraries/jquery.xmleditor
* http://www.lexiconista.com/xonomy/web-based-xml-editors/

Credits:

* Many individuals contribitued individual entries
* Andrew Draskoy did the initial work to put this data into xml
* Aaron Elkiss helped re-create the .xsd and validate things
